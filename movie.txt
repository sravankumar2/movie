	"Goal! The Dream Begins" is a good movie to learn lot and importance of Goal in life.
 In this movie i like the character of hero's grand Mother and her belief on  hero.
we have to set our Goal and works hard until we achieve that, We need to believe in ourselves and follow our dreams and Do not Give up at any point of time even we fail 
try again  and again.
The movie is a good inspiration for every one to achieve their goals.
